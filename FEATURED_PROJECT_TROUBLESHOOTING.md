## 🔍 **Quick Check - Use the Debug Tool**

Visit: `http://localhost:8080/debug-featured.html`

Click **"Analyze Featured Projects"** to see exactly what's wrong.

## 🎯 **Most Common Issues & Solutions:**

### ❌ **Issue 1: Project is Featured but still DRAFT**
**Problem**: Project shows as featured in admin but status is "draft"  
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Admin Panel → Edit your project
2. Change Status from "Draft" to "Published"  
3. Save project

### ❌ **Issue 2: Project is Published but NOT Featured**
**Problem**: Featured button didn't save properly  
**Solution**:
1. Go to Admin Panel → Find your project
2. Click "Feature" button again
3. Verify it shows "Remove" button (meaning it's featured)

### ❌ **Issue 3: Project has no images**
**Problem**: Homepage carousel requires images  
**Solution**:
1. Go to Admin Panel → Your project → "Images" button
2. Upload at least one image or use "Generate Sample Images"
3. Set one as Hero image

## 🧪 **Quick Test:**

**In browser console (F12), run:**
```javascript
// See all your projects
const projects = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cityexperts_projects') || '[]');

// See which ones are featured AND published
const featured = projects.filter(p => p.featured === true && (p.status === 'published' || !p.status));

console.log('Featured & Published projects:', featured);
```

## ✅ **Expected Results:**

Your project should be:
- ✅ **Status**: "published" 
- ✅ **Featured**: true
- ✅ **Has Images**: At least one image uploaded

## 🚀 **After Fixing:**

1. **Refresh the homepage**: `http://localhost:8080/src/index.html`
2. **Look for**: Featured Projects section should show your project
3. **Verify**: Project appears in the carousel with image and details

**Most likely issue**: Your project is featured but still has status "draft" instead of "published". Change it to published in the admin panel!
