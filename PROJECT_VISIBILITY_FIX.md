# Project Not Showing Issue - Fixed! ✅

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified:**

The issue was that your **projects page was only loading from the JSON file**, but when you add a project in the admin panel, it **saves to localStorage**. The two systems weren't connected!

## 🛠 **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Projects Page (`projects.js`)**
- ✅ Now checks `localStorage` first (for admin changes)
- ✅ Falls back to JSON file if no localStorage data
- ✅ Filters for `published` projects only (proper CMS behavior)

### 2. **Homepage Featured Carousel (`main.js`)**  
- ✅ Now checks `localStorage` first (for admin changes)
- ✅ Falls back to JSON file if no localStorage data
- ✅ Shows featured projects that are published

### 3. **Added Debug Tool**
- ✅ `debug-projects.html` to see all project data
- ✅ Shows localStorage vs JSON file content
- ✅ Displays project status and featured flags

## 🎯 **How to Make Your Project Visible:**

### **Option 1: Publish the Project (Recommended)**
1. Go to **Admin Panel** → **Projects**
2. Find your new project and click **"Edit"**
3. Change **Status** from "Draft" to **"Published"**
4. Click **"Save Project"**
5. ✅ Now it will appear on the projects page!

### **Option 2: Feature the Project** 
1. In admin panel, click **"Feature"** button on your project
2. ✅ It will appear in the homepage carousel (if published)

## 🔄 **Current Behavior (Working as Intended):**

- **Draft Projects**: Only visible in admin panel
- **Published Projects**: Visible on public projects page
- **Featured Projects**: Visible on homepage carousel (if published)

## 🧪 **Test Your Fix:**

1. **Check Data**: Visit `http://localhost:8080/debug-projects.html`
2. **Edit Project**: Set status to "Published" in admin
3. **View Result**: Visit `http://localhost:8080/src/projects.html`
4. **Verify**: Your project should now be visible!

## 📊 **Quick Debug Commands:**

Open browser console on any page and run:
```javascript
// See all projects in localStorage
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cityexperts_projects') || '[]')

// See only published projects  
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cityexperts_projects') || '[]')
  .filter(p => p.status === 'published')

// See only featured projects
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cityexperts_projects') || '[]')
  .filter(p => p.featured === true)
```

**✅ Problem Solved!** Your project will now appear once you set its status to "Published" in the admin panel.
